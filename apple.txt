@trisha_ps @iCloud is Cloudy. @apple tech, not very techy.
@electricsoup It has to connect to @Apple to process commands, which it is failing to do right now
See @Apple, that what's happen when you release iPhone 4S with same crappy design as the old phone!
This. RT @bonkoif Looks like @Apple did not appropriately project the resources needed for Siri. Not very reliable

Spoke to an @Apple rep on phone & could hear her tv blaring in the bg. She said, "I can't actually help u, just direct u back to the web"
What's wrong with Siri today @apple
@Apple Siri is down!
I'm suspecting @Apple timed the health-decline of my iPhone 4 perfectly with the iPhone 4s release... My battery is seriously ailing.
on hold for another half hour. phone is ringing but no one is picking up.@apple you stink.
Ok this @Apple software update for the #iphone is taking waaaaay too long! #annoyed
@Apple would do better to inform customers properly about migrating to #iCloud - many complaints lead to #image damage URL
@apple does iOS 5 rape your battery life? or am I just using my phone a lot since getting it
@jane73 @Gazmaz hopefully it's a small bug @Apple must be fixing it. RIGHT APPLE }:0( #itjustworks
@samsung, @apple, you do realise you're just really pissing off the customer base AS WELL AS looking petty.
@Apple - why do I have to have apps I am updating in their original 'folder' location? That was painful.
@apple domain fail. Open 2 hrs late for walk in ppl. Store was empty and i only need a skin 4 my screen. You represent customer service FAIL
@BrianMincey @apple the chipsets tear through battery life. Coworker has a htc thunderbolt that he gets about 3 hours of life.
I wish the Apple updater would stop trying to ram iTunes down my throat. I don't own a pissing iPhone @apple
Is it me or does my #iPhone run slower since the #iOS 5 update? @apple @Verizon

@twalve @apple you know the issues they have with DST and alarms :p
Why book @Apple Genius Bar if after 2.5 hours you still can't be served. Disappointing Apple Store Sydney. #thanksfornothing
Apparently @Apple genius training doesn't extend to clocks & service. They're half an hour late for my appointment and couldn't let me know?
screw you @apple iOS 5. I can't download this crap, and I'm tired of trying. Get this problem figured out about my connection timing out
Wow. iCloud's mail is down. 1st the iOS 5 upgrade issues and now this. I really hope this isn't @apple without Steve Jobs.
@apple why don't you guys test your upgrades before you put them out. 15 1/2 hrs u guys wasted of my time yesterday. Thanks.
what is going on with all my @Apple products?! First my #iPad freezes (still is frozen) and then my #iPhone won't turn on!!! #techieTroubles
#iPad in perpetual restore loop after trying to upgrade to #iOS5 :( @apple sux without steve
2nd @apple genius apptment running late 2nd day in row for 2nd dodgy iPod . You make mega $$$ hire some staff.
It took @apple about 7 years just to figure out how to properly syncronize an iPhone. WOW! #ios5
@apple So I went to the 5th Ave store and was told I could wait about 4 hours to get a 4S. Needless to say I'm back at the hotel relaxing.
Overall I am a fan of the iPhone 4S; however, my Siri has issues connecting to the network @Apple
Terrible customer service at Los Gatos @Apple! Why do I have to pay $199 for a bad home button on my iPhone?!?
@Apple thank you for sucking so much. I cannot believe you would sell something online that isn't made

All I can say about @Apple right now is #GoodRiddance ‚Äî See? Cancer isn't ALL BAD!
@twitter can you look at problem on iPad where it won't open @ messages. It just crashes the app. You too @apple maybe your fault.
@apple What's the point of iCloud wireless updates when ios5 now forces me to use the computer to charge my ipod touch now? #worstupdateever
@robert_terpstra no worries bud, ps: they're saying that the 4s is having a lot of network issues right now. (I'm @apple for mac problems)
I hate you @apple for not sending Toledo,oh @bestbuy any @iPhone for @verizon even after I pre ordered!!!
@pmphillips @apple If my non-Apple equipment broke this often, I guess I'd need an Asus genius bar. But it doesn't, so I don't :-)
Why is the new @apple iPhone OS duplicating all my iCal events? There's 2 of everything. How do I fix it? (tried turning iCloud off)
Dear @Apple, how convenient/handy/thoughtful/smart that after iPhone #ios5 update you're apps won't work anymore! (none!!!) :( #gr%mbl^.%)
Hey @Apple...I know Steve Jobs died & all but my Twitter for iPad app keeps crashing...Fix it...NOW..please..lol -F.Light

IOS5 has one problem, when i save someone in my contacts they don't show his nam becuz of the region/ +965 @apple #apple
I sure as hell better be able to restore my calendar events. Terrible bug apple! @apple #icloud #anothericloudfail
I really hate that @apple won't let you hide the Newsstand app or move it into a folder. It serves no purpose for me.
Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
@apple No location reminders on ipad2! That was the point of updating to iOS 5
Comparing @Office #live with @google #apps and @apple #iCloud , I do not see #iCloud leading the crowd. Do you agree ?
Turns out my computer isn't as fixed as it is meant to be. Fuck you @Apple, I'm going back to your Genius Bar to complain. #annoyed
If @apple doesn't fix iOS5 this week, I'm buying a droid #emptythreats
@apple pls launch #Siri on iphone4 .. Disappointed after spending hours for upgrading to iOS5..
@apple you can suck it you and your fucking iPhones better be glad it's all I like cause the service Is fucking terrible
This is the first time I've been unhappy with any @apple product... Disappointed, and the Internet seems as confused as I am right now.
After a week or so with @Apple's #iOS5 I'm considering going back to #jailbroken 4.2 - same features as 5, plus more. Not as stable, though.
Had issues with #Siri reaching network today. Too many uses or my signal? @apple
The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
Is it me or does #iPhone4s run a little warm sometimes? @apple
@apple WTF why can we not add the newsstand to a folder?! We are already in your walled garden, so please don't remind us of it.
@apple just now seeing none of my Microsoft Office programs work anymore after Lion upgrade. Why??
Dear @Apple, I don't want the newsstand icon on my screen. #notcool
@Blackberry does take better quality photos than @Apple iPhone though. I give them that! #photograhersEye
Ok @iTunesMusic idk wth is up but after syncing my phone my album art is out of order! WTF @Apple!
@apple I'm still waiting for you to deliver my phone to @sprint
I will never purchase another @Apple product for the rest of my life. I am glad Steve Jobs is fucking dead. MAY YOU FUCKING ROT IN HELL!!!!!
Thanks to @Apple my new iMac is a brick. I cannot re-install Lion and I cannot purchase it because it was installed by the former owner.
Asked #Siri "Where's Baby Lisa?" and was told "sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the network right now." @apple server fail. #ios5
Only thing #iOS.5 has done is deleted my tiger woods game and made impossible to retrieve. Thanks @Apple!
Damn you @apple for breaking wififofum! It continued to work in ios 4. Was one of my most used apps. Damn Apple's overbearing policies!

@thejcurt unlocking it at @apple store. RIP, Mr. Jobs.
Siri is cool but more importantly handy and FUNNY. @Apple please configure it for Canada. What's with the racism, EH?

#SaturdayCute: Shit That #Siri Says. @Apple designers knew what people were going to ask the new digital assistant... URL
@thatstevegray done that buddy, just surprised that there's no option from @apple & if you turn it back on it brings back the pics u delete
SpeechTrans URL on @Apple App store listed as the #best bi-directional #Speech To Speech #Translator --- Posts on Twitter
So @apple changed the look of their on/off toggle. I wonder how long it will take for all the hip web apps to follow...
I want everybody on earth to iMessage me. Is there anyway the world can iMessage me without giving them my phone number??? @Apple

Iphone update is great but seriously @apple let me delete stuff I dont want like gamecenter. Steve wont mind...

What do we have to do to get Flash on #iPad? @Apple please please please change your mind. Thank you in advance! @kusi_sk @PeterNemcok
@ireton Perhaps it's time for @Apple to come out with an app called iSuck that lets you know which apps are killing your battery life
RT @TheMacMob: Sprint, Verizon & AT&T @Apple Stores URL
@xwordy iCloud was new; I didn't need weather or stocks but they were there pre #ios5 so I'm not hopeful that this will help @apple
Thinking more, I want Android to do an iMessage service & for @Google & @Apple to interconnect. They would if the cared about their users.
@apple in Austin: domain location - umbrellas are nice but being staffed properly would be better.
bored - need a new intriguing #app for my #iPad. Any suggestions? @apple #yyc @Gadget_Guy
@KeepnUpWitTBoyd @AppStore @iTunesMusic they fixed a bug Thursday after I had done my update? Thus my issue, spent Fri @apple #iOS5
And @Apple I still have an old MBP from 2006 which I use - which can't run #Lion, I still like to sync it!
@moLifer26 @apple When we find people standing in the middle of blood-soaked rooms saying, "Siri told me to?" #noreallyihearvoices

@notleifgarrett @apple wished their on hold music played "Pictures of You".
@RealEstateGuyWI All about yesterday's @Apple upgrade. Helpful but maddening
after being on hold with @apple for the last 30 mins, i really like their music selection of on-hold music. White Stripes, Ray Lamontagne...
